        <p style="font-family:verdana"><strong> When the universe began, it was said that there was a big bang. This big bang will start the cycle of the universe, stars, planets, and eventually humnans.
             The universe is so vast and ever expanding that most of the space is empty waiting for a star or objects to form. Our planet is one of if not billions of planets and stars in the galaxy.
             Before life can start, there are specific requirements that must be in place for life to began, for example: right tempurature, oxygen being produced, a sun, gravity, etc.

        <p style="color:purple; font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>I would have loved to study the cosmos but we are not at the right time to learn more than there already is to learn. The only unknown thing that scientest can't wrap their head around is dark matter, which makes up most of our galaxy.
             Ever since I was a kid, I loved scifi, ufos, and spaceships/rockets, I hope to one day to be employed by nasa creating systems for rocketships.
             That will be the closest I can be, helping explore the cosmos with my expertise in technology. One of my wishes is before I leave this forever,
             I hope we will be colonizing mars are have reached outside the milkyway (our galaxy).
